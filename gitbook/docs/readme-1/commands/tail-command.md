### üí° Additional Tips

* **Using `tail -f` with multiple files**: The `-f` option allows you to view real-time updates, which is great for log files or watching a file being written to.
*   **Combining with `grep`**: You can pipe the output of `tail` to `grep` to filter the results.

    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep "error"
    ```
* **Use `Ctrl + C`** to stop following the file when using `tail -f`.

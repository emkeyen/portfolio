# Best tips for running jMeter tests

### ‚ö° 1. Run Tests in Non-GUI Mode for Performance
**Why**: JMeter's graphical user interface (GUI) consumes more resources and slows down the testing process. Running tests in non-GUI mode (`-n`) eliminates this overhead.

**Tip**: Always run performance/load tests from the command line using the `-n` flag to avoid unnecessary resource usage by the GUI.

**Command**:
```bash
jmeter -n -t test_plan.jmx -l results.jtl
```

### üñ•Ô∏è 2. Use a Dedicated Test Machine
**Why**: JMeter can be resource-intensive, especially when running large tests. It‚Äôs ideal to execute tests on a separate, dedicated machine to avoid overloading your local environment.

**Tip**: Use a machine that is optimized for test execution with sufficient CPU, RAM, and disk space to ensure smooth test performance.

### üåê 3. Use Remote Servers for Distributed Testing
**Why**: For large-scale load tests, running them on a single machine might not be feasible. Distributed testing across multiple JMeter servers helps simulate a larger load.

**Tip**: Set up a distributed testing environment with remote servers by defining them in the `remote_hosts` configuration file or using the `-r` option to distribute the load effectively.

**Command**:
```bash
jmeter -n -t test_plan.jmx -r
```

### üìä 4. Generate Reports After Test Completion
**Why**: To avoid consuming system resources during test execution, it's a good practice to generate reports after the test run finishes rather than in real time. This allows JMeter to focus on testing without overloading your system.

**Tip**: Use the `-e` and `-o` options to generate a dashboard report after the test completes. This can be done in the CLI to avoid the overhead of report generation during the test run.

**Command**:
```bash
jmeter -g results.jtl -e -o /path/to/report
```

### üßπ 5. Delete Previous Test Results Before Running New Tests
**Why**: Old result files and reports may interfere with new test runs and affect the accuracy of your results. Keeping old data might also result in confusion or incorrect conclusions.

**Tip**: Use the `-f` flag to force JMeter to delete any existing result and report files before starting a new test, ensuring a clean slate for each test run.

**Command**:
```bash
jmeter -n -t test_plan.jmx -l results.jtl -f
```
---

### üîß 6. Use JMeter Properties for Flexibility
**Why**: Custom properties can be passed to JMeter at runtime, making tests more flexible and reusable across different environments or scenarios. This is especially useful for handling multiple configurations.

**Tip**: Use the `-J` option to define properties (e.g., for different servers, ports, or configurations). This allows for dynamic configuration without modifying the test plan.

**Command**:
```bash
jmeter -n -t test_plan.jmx -Jserver.host=localhost -Jserver.port=8080
```

### üìù 7. Use Logging Levels to Troubleshoot
**Why**: In non-GUI mode, detailed logs help with debugging test failures or performance bottlenecks. It‚Äôs essential to capture logs with the right level of detail based on your needs.

**Tip**: Adjust the log level using the `-L` option to get more or less verbose output based on your needs. Choose from levels like DEBUG, INFO, or WARN.

**Command**:
```bash
jmeter -n -t test_plan.jmx -L jmeter.util=DEBUG
```
---

### üìà 8. Monitor Test Results in Real-Time
**Why**: While JMeter is running, it's helpful to monitor the performance of the system under test (SUT) in real-time.

**Tip**: Use `jconsole` or any third-party tool to monitor system metrics (e.g., CPU, memory) while tests are executing. You can also consider integrating JMeter with Grafana for real-time visualization of test results.

---

### ‚úÖ 9. Use Assertions to Validate Results
**Why**: Assertions help validate if your test execution is proceeding correctly. For performance tests, use assertions like Response Time or Throughput to check that the server is handling load as expected.

**Tip**: Although assertions are not needed for every test, use them selectively to make sure the system behaves correctly under load.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 10. Optimize the Thread Group Settings
**Why**: The configuration of the thread group can significantly impact performance. Overloading the test with an excessive number of threads or ramp-up time can skew results.

**Tip**: Set realistic values for the number of threads (users), ramp-up period, and loop count to simulate actual user behavior.
